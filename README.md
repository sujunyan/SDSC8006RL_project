# SDSC8006 Reinforcement Learning Project 

This serves as a code repository for SDSC8006 Reinforcement learning class project. In this project, we will use RL to play a pacman game.

## How to start
For a quick start, to play the game with keyboard, run
```
python pacman.py
```
To use an example agent, run
```
python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent
```
To explore more parameters, run
```
python pacman.py -h 
```

The main algorithm is implemented in the file multiAgents.py. One can also refer to the https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp21/project2/ for other details.
